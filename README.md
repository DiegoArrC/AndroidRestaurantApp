# Overview

The app that I’ve built is a simulation of a restaurant app, where a user can add items to a cart from a menu, and go to a checkout page, where the cart can be reviewed, and an order confirmation can be placed. To use the app, two buttons are created for each individual orderable item, and each button will either add a single instance for an individual item or remove it from one from the cart. I built this app to both understand how to use a different development environment and learn how to make an application using Kotlin, a language that I had previously not known.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add more items to allow for a dynamically populated checkout, as opposed to a static, hard-coded approach.
* Connect app to a database, such as Google’s Firestore, a cloud database.
* Ensure that dynamically processed data is properly handled across different screens
* Create custom structures visually, such as blocking out each individual item, greying out any that are unavailable, and animations for click events.
